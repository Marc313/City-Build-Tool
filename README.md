# City Builder
Create towns and cities using provided assets or your own assets in this easy to use City Building tool!

City Builder is a powerful tool for creating large-scale cities quickly and efficiently. Its flexible grid-based system allows users to build with ease, while still maintaining a high level of creative freedom. With a wide range of pre-built objects to choose from and the ability to import custom models, users can easily create unique and dynamic cities and towns.
Once a model is imported, it becomes part of the user's personal library of objects that can be placed anywhere within the city, making it easy to reuse the same model in multiple locations.
